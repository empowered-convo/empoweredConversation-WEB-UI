          <h3> How does Empowered Conversation work?</h3>
          <p>When a survivor is ready to disclose about their assault, they go
            onto our website and input the cell phone number of the person they
            will disclose to.</p>
          <p>That person then receives a text message from our site that says
            someone they love wants to have a conversation with them about
            sexual
            assault and are provided with a link to a short, trauma-informed
            module on assault, how best to respond, and what to avoid so as not
            to
            re-trigger the survivor.</p>
          <p>Once the module is completed, a text is generated back to the
            survivor, letting them know the person they want to disclose to is
            ready to listen.</p>
        </section>
        <section class='our-approach'>
          <div>
            <h3>Why is our approach different?</h3>
            <h4>For the survivor</h4> <p>Our tool takes the burden off of the
              survivor for having to educate their loved ones about assault
              during
              disclosure because we provide that training ahead of time. This
              allows the survivor to feel more empowered in the conversation,
              knowing their loved one already has a foundational understanding
              of
              assault and best practices for how to support them.</p>
          </div>
          <div><h4>For the family member/friend</h4> <p>Presently in a
              disclosure,
              the family member/friend may be hearing about the assault for the
              first time as the survivor is in front of them. They feel their
              own
              shock, pain and denial, the pain and grief of the survivor, and
              need
              to respond in a sensitive and empathetic way. These three elements
              of the disclosure happen in a short amount of time and can lead to
              negative reactions on the part of the family member/friend, even
              if
              they are well-meaning. Our tool allows time for the family
              member/friend to integrate the information and process their own
              emotions, so that when they respond to the survivor they are
              better
              able to empower and support.</p></div>
