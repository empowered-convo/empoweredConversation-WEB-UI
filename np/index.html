              <p>
                When a survivor is ready to disclose about their assault, they go
                onto our website and input the cell phone number of the person they
                will disclose to.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='card'>
                <div class="steps">2</div>
              <p>
                That person then receives a text message from our site that says
                someone they love wants to have a conversation with them about
                sexual assault and are provided with a link to a short,
                trauma-informed module on assault, how best to respond, and what to
                avoid so as not to re-trigger the survivor.

              <div class="steps">3</div>

                Once the module is completed, a text is generated back to the
                survivor, letting them know the person they want to disclose to is
                ready to listen.

            <h3>For the survivor</h3>
            <p>
              Our tool takes the burden off of the survivor for having to
              educate their loved ones about assault during disclosure because
              we provide that training ahead of time. This allows the survivor
              to feel more empowered in the conversation, knowing their loved
              one already has a foundational understanding of assault and best
              practices for how to support them.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>For the family member/friend</h3>
            <p>
              Presently in a disclosure, the family member/friend may be hearing
              about the assault for the first time as the survivor is in front
              of them. They feel their own shock, pain and denial, the pain and
              grief of the survivor, and need to respond in a sensitive and
              empathetic way.</p> 
              <p> These three elements of the disclosure happen in a
              short amount of time and can lead to negative reactions on the
              part of the family member/friend, even if they are well-meaning.</p>
              <p>
              Our tool allows time for the family member/friend to integrate the
              information and process their own emotions, so that when they
              respond to the survivor they are better able to empower and
              support.
