  <div class="intro"><h2>How does Empowered Conversation work?</h2></div>
  <div class="how">
    <div class="step step1"><p><a href="#">When a survivor</a> is ready to disclose about their assault, they go onto our website and input the cell phone number of the person they will disclose to.</p></div>
    <div class="step step2"><p>That person then receives a text message from our site that says someone they love wants to have a conversation with them about sexual assault and are provided with a link to a short, trauma-informed module on assault, how best to respond, and what to avoid so as not to re-trigger the survivor.</p></div>
    <div class="step step3"><p>Once the module is completed, a text is generated back to the survivor, letting them know the person they want to disclose to is ready to listen.</p></div>
  </div>

  <div class="approach">
      <h2>Why is our approach different?</h2>
      <h3>For the survivor</h3>
      <p>Our tool takes the burden off of the survivor for having to educate their loved ones about assault during disclosure because we provide that training ahead of time.</p>
      <p>This allows the survivor to feel more empowered in the conversation, knowing their loved one already has a foundational understanding of assault and best practices for how to support them.</p>
      <h3>For the family member/friend</h3>
      <p>Presently in a disclosure, the family member/friend may be hearing about the assault for the first time as the survivor is in front of them.</p>
      <p>They feel their own shock, pain and denial, the pain and grief of the survivor, and need to respond in a sensitive and empathetic way.</p>
      <p>These three elements of the disclosure happen in a short amount of time and can lead to negative reactions on the part of the family member/friend, even if they are well-meaning. </p>
      <p>Our tool allows time for the family member/friend to integrate the information and process their own emotions, so that when they respond to the survivor they are better able to empower and support.</p>
