    <div class="for-survivor">
        <h3>For the survivor</h3>
        <p>Our tool takes the burden off of the survivor for having to educate their loved ones about assault during disclosure because we provide that training ahead of time.</p>
        <p>This allows the survivor to feel more empowered in the conversation, knowing their loved one already has a foundational understanding of assault and best practices for how to support them.</p>

        <img src="assets/undraw_problem_solving_ft81.svg" alt="Our Approach"></div>
    <div class="for-recipient">
      <h3>For the family member/friend</h3>
      <p>Presently in a disclosure, the family member/friend may be hearing about the assault for the first time as the survivor is in front of them. They feel their own shock, pain and denial, the pain and grief of the survivor, and need to respond in a sensitive and empathetic way.</p>
      <p>These three elements of the disclosure happen in a short amount of time and can lead to negative reactions on the part of the family member/friend, even if they are well-meaning. </p>
      <p>Our tool allows time for the family member/friend to integrate the information and process their own emotions, so that when they respond to the survivor they are better able to empower and support.</p>
